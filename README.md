## 💬 About Myaku-Myaku Sama

See wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myaku-Myaku

"Sama"(様) means honorific title in Japanese.

Since ancient times in Japan, unusual natural phenomena and mysterious occurrences have often been appeased by venerating them as deities. Many shrines and small roadside altars across the country trace their origins to such "deities". Out of fear and respect, people traditionally attach the honorific "sama" when addressing these beings.

Against that cultural background, Japanese internet users commonly refer to Myaku-Myaku with the "Sama" honorific—usually written as "Myaku-Myaku Sama".
